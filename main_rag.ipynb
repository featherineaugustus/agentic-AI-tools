Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks.

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a sequence-to-sequence\\narchitecture that makes heavy use of self-attention. Radford et al. (a) applied it to autoregressive lan-\\nguage modeling by using a stack of Transformer decoders. Since then, Transformer-based language\\nmodels have dominated NLP, achieving the state-of-the-art in many tasks. A new paradigm emerged\\nwith BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) – both are large Transformer lan-\\n8'),\n",

Consequently,\\nadapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional\\nlatency. While as pointed out in R ¨uckl´e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can\\nbe mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the\\nhardware parallelism. We conﬁrm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium\\nand point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where\\nthe added latency can be signiﬁcant.\\nWe measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging\\nover 100 trials.

Introduction\\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\\nIt has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\\nto user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\\npre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\\nwere the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\\nThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\\nreasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\\nof effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\\nworks have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\\net al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),'),\n",

However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models.\\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\\nusing pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\\nreasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\\na pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\\nGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\\nDuring training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\\nreasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\\non reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\\n71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\\nof OpenAI-o1-0912.'),\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mWelcome to the first chapter of The Things Fundamentals on LoRaWAN. In this section, you’ll learn why LoRaWAN is so awesome, hear about some great LoRaWAN use cases, and learn the difference between LoRa and LoRaWAN. LoRa LoRa is a wireless modulation technique derived from Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology. It encodes information on radio waves using … The LoRa Alliance’s unwavering commitment to advancing LPWAN technology has empowered us to deliver state-of-the-art, long-range, and low-power IoT solutions that are redefining industries and driving sustainability. May 9, 2019 · LoRaWAN LoRaWAN is a high capacity, Long Range, open, Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) standard designed for LoRa Powered IoT Solutions by the LoRa Alliance. It is a bi-directional protocol which takes full advantage of all the features of the LoRa technology to deliver services including reliable message delivery, end to end security, location and multicast … LoRa vs LoRaWAN Let’s start with defining LoRa - what it is and how it differs from LoRaWAN. LoRa is a wireless technology just like the more commonly used WiFi, Bluetooth, LTE and Zigbee. One technology cannot solve everything and in many cases there are trade-offs that one has to accept . LoRa fulfils the need for low-cost, battery-powered devices that need to send data … Jun 26, 2018 · The answer to “What is LoRa?” isn’t as straightforward as it may seem. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know if you're considering it for your IoT device.\u001b[0m\n",
